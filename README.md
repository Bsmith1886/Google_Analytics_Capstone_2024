## Background - Business Task

A rideshare company in Chicago wishes to analyze how their customers use their products. They are looking to understand how casual and annual members use their services differently so they can convert casual riders to members. 

The company has provided customer data in CSV format going back several years. We will review data from Jan 2023 - Jan 2024. 

## Data Exploration

The data provided was in a series of CSV files each with varying amounts of data. Some of the files were too large to upload directly into bigquery, and first had to be uploaded to Google Cloud Storage. Once uploaded i was able to easily import them into a single bigquery table. 

Now that the files are loaded into Bigquery, I will use SQL to Explore the data.
